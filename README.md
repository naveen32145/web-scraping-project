extracting data from websites. It can be used for a variety of purposes, such as collecting data for analysis, monitoring changes on a website, or even building datasets for machine learning. In this guide, we'll explore how to use Python's requests library to fetch web pages and BeautifulSoup to parse and extract the desired information.
Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the requests and beautifulsoup4 libraries. You can install them using pip:
Step 1: Fetching a Web Page
The first step in web scraping is to fetch the content of the web page you want to scrape. We use the requests library for this purpose. Let's start by fetching the HTML content of a simple web page.

Step 3: Extracting Data
Now that we have the parsed HTML, we can start extracting the data we need. Let's say we want to extract all the headings (h1, h2, h3) from the page.
Step 4: Extracting Links
Another common task in web scraping is extracting all the links from a page. Here's how you can do it:
